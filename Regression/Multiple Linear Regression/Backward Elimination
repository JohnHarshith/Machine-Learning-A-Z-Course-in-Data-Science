Backward Elimination is irrelevant in Python, because the Scikit-Learn library automatically takes care of selecting the statistically significant features when training the model to make accurate predictions.
Just keep this for this Backward Elimination implementation, but keep in mind that in general you don't have to remove manually a dummy variable column because Scikit-Learn takes care of it.
